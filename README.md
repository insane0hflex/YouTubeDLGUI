# YouTubeDLGUI

Simple C# WPF program to use [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/) in a GUI friendly way.

This is a simple GUI that has been tested to mainly support the following sites:
- YouTube
- Soundcloud

It probably works for all other sites youtube-dl supports however.

# Using YouTubeDLGUI

Put the YouTubeDLGUI.exe in the same directory as your youtube-dl.exe. If you want to download files as mp3 - you need to install [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) for Windows, and place the ffmpeg.exe and other .exes located in the \bin\ folder in the same directory as YouTubeDLGUI.exe and youtube-gl.exe
